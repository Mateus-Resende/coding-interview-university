# Cracking the coding interview

## Behavioral questions

### Are you passionate about your work

- Share it somewhere: open source, published work, social media, meetups

### Create preparation grid for projects

- enjoyed, hated, most challenging, hardest bug
- start tracking these things when building stuff

## Estimation questions

### "How much money does gmail make from ads every year?"

- clarify everything I can think of: in US? revenue or profit? past year or over history?
- outline the approach: # of users x # clicks / year x $ / click
- break down components: 300m people in US ~> 200m that use email ~> 80% of people use gmail ~> 80% have non work account
- validate the numbers: $5 billion? ~> no, google's annual revenue is 40 billion, US$ 16 / user

## Technical questions

- Coding & algorithms:

  - pattern matching          => compare to similar problems
  - simplify & generalise     => solve first for a simplified / tweaked problem
  - base case & build         => solve for n = 1, and build solution for n = 2
  - data structure brainstorm => try to apply data structure to solve problem

- Object oriented design:

  - handle ambiguity
  - design the core objects
  - analyze relationships
  - investigate actions

- System design:

  - handle ambiguity => what about the question was ambiguous?
  - make believe => pretend there wasn't a big amount of data
  - get real => go back to the real problem. what breaks?
  - solve problems => solve the issues you just found
